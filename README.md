FinBuddy is an Android application designed to empower individuals—especially women—by helping them manage budgets, plan savings, calculate investments, and achieve financial stability with ease.

This project began as part of the IAccelerate Women's Hackathon by Infosys Springboard, where the idea was first conceptualized and presented.

To know more about the characteristics of the app I designed, check out the PDF given under the directory "doc"!
Feel free to share any suggestions or feedback I can include for future learning:)
